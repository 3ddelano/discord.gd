1. Download the Github repository, either the main branch or a tagged branch eg. `1.0.0`

2. Copy the folder `discord_gd` from `addons` from the downloaded content to the `addons` folder in the directory of your project. If your project does not already have a `addons` folder, make a new one. Your project folder should look something like this:

5. You might need to close and open the Project for the plugin to load.

6. To ensure the plugin is installed, check whether the `DiscordBot` node is added to Godot.
