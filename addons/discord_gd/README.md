This is a regular plugin for Godot.

The plugin now comes with no extra assets to stay lightweight.
If you want to try an example scene, you can see the examples from: [Discord.gd Examples](https://github.com/3ddelano/discord_gd_examples)

> For in-depth installation instructions check the [Installation Wiki](https://github.com/3ddelano/discord.gd/wiki/Installation)

> Note: You will need a valid Discord Bot token available at [Discord Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)


Getting Started
----------

1. After activating the plugin. There will be a new `DiscordBot` node added to Godot.
Click on any node in the scene tree of your scene for example `Root` and add the `DiscordBot` node as a child.

2. Connect the various signals (`bot_ready`, `guild_create`, `message_create`, `message_delete`, etc) of the `DiscordBot` node to the parent node, either through the editor or in the script using the `connect()` method.

3. Attach a script to the `Root` node.

```GDScript
extends Node2D

func _ready():
	var discord_bot = $DiscordBot
	discord_bot.TOKEN = "your_bot_token_here"
	discord_bot.login()
	discord_bot.connect("bot_ready", self, "_on_DiscordBot_bot_ready")

func _on_DiscordBot_bot_ready(bot: DiscordBot):
	print('Logged in as ' + bot.user.username + '#' + bot.user.discriminator)
	print('Listening on ' + str(bot.channels.size()) + ' channels and ' + str(bot.guilds.size()) ' guilds.')

```
